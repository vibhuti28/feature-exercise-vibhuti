Requirement:
Written in the PHP programming language, implement the code for a supermarket
checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items.
In a normal supermarket, items for sale are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or
‘SKUs’. In our store, we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on) to
represent these SKUs. Our goods are priced individually, however, some items are
multi-priced: buy n of them, and they’ll cost you y instead.
For example, item ‘A’ might cost £0.50 individually, but this week we have a special
offer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you £1.30. In fact, this week’s prices are:

Item Unit Price Special Price
A 50 3 for 130
B 30 2 for 45
C 20 2 for 38
3 for 50 1
D 15 5 if purchased
with an ‘A’ 2

E 5

 This exercise will be used to gauge how you approach a software engineering
problem – the processes you use, the quality of your code and the robustness of your
solution.
 DO use as many or as few technologies and processes as you normally would when
working as a Software Engineer
 Feel free to write tests, use version control and rely on the tools provided by
the IDE.

 DON’T get hung up on the specifics of the implementation
 The problem is intentionally abstract, giving you the freedom to come up
with your own unique solution.
 This is an opportunity to demonstrate your way of working and your
approach to creative problem solving – there are no precise user
requirements (aside from the specification above).

 A template project has been set up in IntelliJ IDEA on a feature branch called
feature-exercise-&lt;yourname&gt; to get you started
 This exercise will last approximately 1.5 hours

1 The price calculated for any quantity of an SKU with multiple special prices will be the cheapest
combination of its special prices. For example: If you buy 5 ‘C’s you would get 2 for 38 + 3 for 50.
If you buy 4 ‘C’s you would get 3 for 50 + 1 for 20 rather than 2 for 38 + 2 for 38.
2 For every ‘D’ purchased, if there is also an ‘A’ purchased, it will cost 5 instead of 15. For
example, if you buy 10 ‘D’s and 6 ‘A’s, 6 of the ‘D’s will cost 5 each whilst the other 4 will cost 15



To Run This code :

Please follow the below steps:

1) Create folder with supermarket name
2) Then go inside the folder .
3) Run composer install command
4) Then go to the tests/SupermarketTest.php and run phpunit test and check the cases of supermarket checkout
